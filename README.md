### Hello hello 👋

<!--
**RayCzajaJr/RayCzajaJr** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
- My name is Ray and I am currently a postdoc at NCEAS (National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis) at UCSB (University of California, Santa Barbara).
- I’m currently working on a variety of projects, under the Gulf Ecosystem Intiative, with a general theme of fisheries ecology in the Gulf of Mexico. Although, a good chunk of my current research, as well as my doctoral research, focuses on larval ecology.
- 📫 How to reach me: rayczajajr@gmail.com or raymondczaja@ucsb.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a (very) amateur underwater photographer.
